Description
This project is part of the AirBnB clone series where we build a simplified version of the AirBnB web application. The command interpreter is the core component that allows users to create, manipulate, and manage objects within the system, such as users, places, and cities. The interpreter works in a similar fashion to a shell, allowing commands to be entered to interact with the applicationâ€™s back-end.

This first step focuses on building a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects through object-oriented programming and persistent storage using JSON. This command interpreter will serve as the foundation for future features like the web interface, database, and API integration.
